Instagram is a complex application that involves a combination of various technologies and tools. Here are some of the key technologies and tools commonly used in building an application like Instagram:

Front-end Development:

React Native: A JavaScript framework for building mobile apps that can run on both iOS and Android platforms.
JavaScript/TypeScript: The programming languages used for writing the front-end code.
Redux: A state management library for managing application state.
React Navigation: A library for handling navigation between screens in React Native apps.
Axios: A popular HTTP client library for making API requests.
Back-end Development:

Python: The primary programming language used by Instagram for its backend.
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend infrastructure.
Django REST Framework: A powerful toolkit for building RESTful APIs with Django.
PostgreSQL: A relational database management system used by Instagram for storing data.
Redis: An in-memory data structure store used for caching and other data storage needs.
Celery: A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous tasks in the background.
Infrastructure and Deployment:

Amazon Web Services (AWS): A cloud computing platform used for hosting and scaling Instagram's infrastructure.
Docker: A containerization platform used for packaging applications and their dependencies.
Kubernetes: An orchestration tool used for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
Other Tools and Technologies:

Git: A version control system used for source code management.
GitHub: A popular platform for hosting and collaborating on code repositories.
Visual Studio Code: A widely used code editor for writing and editing code.
Postman: A tool for testing and debugging API requests.
It's important to note that the above list is not exhaustive, and Instagram likely uses a combination of additional tools, libraries, and technologies to meet its specific requirements.

While these technologies and tools have been associated with Instagram's development, the exact stack and implementation details are based on available information and can evolve over time. Instagram's development team may have also built custom solutions tailored to their specific needs.
